# Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a classic paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

2. Player 1 (X) starts the game.
3. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
4. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
